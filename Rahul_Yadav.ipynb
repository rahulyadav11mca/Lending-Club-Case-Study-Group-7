    "\n",
    "You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.\n",
    "2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company."

    "### 1.2. Dataset Attributes\n",
    "#### Decision Matrix\n",
    "When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:\n",
    "1. Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:\n",
    "- Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)\n",
    "- Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet - completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.\n",
    "- Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan \n",
    "2. Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)\n",
    "#### Business Objectives\n",
    "This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. \n",
    "\n",
    "If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. \n"

    "\n",
    "- Grade B had the highest number of \"Charged off\" loan applicants, with a total of 1,352 applicants, indicating that applicants with this credit grade faced challenges in repaying their loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short-term loans with a duration of 36 months were the most popular among \"Charged off\" applicants, with 3,006 applications. This suggests that a significant portion of applicants who experienced loan default chose shorter repayment terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applicants who had been employed for more than 10 years accounted for the highest number of \"Charged off\" loans, totaling 1,474. This indicates that long-term employment history did not necessarily guarantee successful loan repayment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The year 2011 recorded the highest number of \"Charged off\" loan applications, totalling 3,152, signaling a positive trend in the number of applicants facing loan defaults over the years. This could be indicative of economic or financial challenges during that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Charged off\" loans were predominantly taken during the 4th quarter, with 2,284 applications, primarily in December. This peak in loan applications during the holiday season might suggest that financial pressures during the holidays contributed to loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unordered Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- California had the highest number of \"Charged off\" loan applicants, with 1,055 applicants. For such applicants, the lending company needs to implement stricter eligibility criteria or credit assessments due to a higher number of \"Charged off\" applicants from this state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debt consolidation was the primary loan purpose for most \"Charged off\" loan applicants, with 2,633 applicants selecting this option. The lending company needs to exercise caution when approving loans for debt consolidation purposes, as it was the primary loan purpose for many \"Charged off\" applicants.\n",

    "- The majority of \"Charged off\" loan participants, totaling 2,715 individuals, lived in rented houses. The lending company must assess the financial stability of applicants living in rented houses, as they may be more susceptible to economic fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A significant number of loan participants, specifically 5,317 individuals, were loan defaulters, unable to clear their loans. The lending company should enhance risk assessment practices, including stricter credit checks and lower loan-to-value ratios, for applicants with a history of loan defaults.

    "- 1,561 loan applicants who charged off had annual salaries less than 40,000 USD. The lending company should exercise caution when lending to individuals with low annual salaries. They should implement rigorous income verification and assess repayment capacity more thoroughly for applicants in this income bracket.\n",
    "- Among loan participants who charged off (2,025), a considerable portion belonged to the interest rate bucket of 13%-17%. To reduce the risk of default, the lending company should consider offering loans at lower interest rates when possible.\n",
    "- 1,695 loan participants who charged off received loan amounts of 15,000 USD and above. The lending company should evaluate applicants seeking higher loan amounts carefully. They should ensure the applicants must have a strong credit history and repayment capability to handle larger loans.\n",
    "- 1,608 loan participants who charged off received funded amounts of 15,000 USD and above. The lending company should ensure that the funded amounts align with the borrower's financial capacity. They should conduct thorough credit assessments for larger loan requests.\n",
    "- Among loan participants who charged off, 1,178 loan applicants had very high debt-to-income ratios. The lending company should implement strict debt-to-income ratio requirements to prevent lending to individuals with unsustainable levels of debt relative to their income.\n",
    "- Among loan participants who charged off, it's observed that the majority of them had monthly installment amounts falling within the range of 160-440 USD. The lending company should closely monitor and assess applicants with similar installment amounts to mitigate the risk of loan defaults."

    "1. **Risk Assessment for Grades B, C, and D**: Since loan applicants from Grades B, C, and D contribute to most of the \"Charged Off\" loans, the company should consider implementing stricter risk assessment and underwriting criteria for applicants falling into these grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subgrades B3, B4, and B5**: Pay special attention to applicants with Subgrades B3, B4, and B5, as they are more likely to charge off. Implementing additional risk mitigation measures or offering them lower loan amounts could be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Term Length**: Given that applicants opting for 60-month loans are more likely to default, the company should consider evaluating the risk associated with longer-term loans and potentially limiting the maximum term or adjusting interest rates accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experience and Default Probability**: Loan applicants with ten or more years of experience are more likely to default. This suggests that experience alone may not be a reliable indicator of creditworthiness. The company should use a more comprehensive credit scoring system that factors in other risk-related attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Positive Growth Trend**: The steady increase in the number of loan applicants from 2007 to 2011 indicates growth in the market. The company can capitalize on this trend by maintaining a competitive edge in the industry while keeping risk management practices robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Seasonal Trends**: December and Q4 are peak periods for loan applications, likely due to the holiday season. The company should anticipate increased demand during these periods and ensure efficient processing to meet customer needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Debt Consolidation Risk**: Since debt consolidation is the category with the maximum number of loans and high default rates, the company should carefully evaluate applicants seeking debt consolidation loans and potentially adjust interest rates or offer financial counseling services.\n",

    "8. **Housing Status and Default Risk**: Applicants living in rented or mortgaged houses are more likely to default. This information can be considered in the underwriting process to assess housing stability and its impact on repayment ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Verification Process**: Verified loan applicants are defaulting more than those who are not verified. The company should review its verification process to ensure it effectively assesses applicant creditworthiness and consider improvements or adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Geographic Risk**: Loan applicants from states like California (CA), Florida (FL), and New York (NY) are more likely to default. The company should monitor regional risk trends and adjust lending strategies or rates accordingly in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **High Loan Amounts**: Applicants receiving loan amounts of $15,000 or higher are more likely to default. The company can mitigate this risk by conducting more thorough assessments for larger loan requests and potentially capping loan amounts for higher-risk applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **DTI and Interest Rates**: High Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios and interest rates in the 13%-17% range are associated with defaults. The company should review its interest rate determination process and consider adjusting rates based on DTI ratios to better align with the borrower's ability to repay.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Low Annual Income**: Applicants with annual incomes less than $40,000 have a higher likelihood of defaulting. The company should consider offering financial education resources or setting maximum loan amounts based on income levels to ensure affordability for borrowers.\n"
